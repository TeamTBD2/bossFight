## Problem Identified (Year 2080)

In the year 2080, the widespread adoption of immersive digital environments like VR and AR has led to a significant decline in physical activity and real-world social interaction, especially among younger generations. With most work, education, and entertainment shifting into fully virtual platforms, users spend excessive time in sedentary, isolated digital environments. This has resulted in rising rates of physical health issues, weakened social skills, and increased mental health concerns. The challenge lies in balancing immersive technology use with real-world engagement to foster healthier, more socially connected lifestyles.

Screen time statistics:

According to a study by the American Psychological Association (2023), screen time among teens has increased by over 50% in the past decade, with teens spending an average of 7–9 hours per day on digital devices.

The World Health Organization (2025) has reported a global rise in physical health issues, with over 30% of adolescents now classified as overweight or obese, largely due to reduced physical activity tied to increased screen time.

This rise in screen time and digital immersion has caused a cascade of health concerns, including:

Increased mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and loneliness, as individuals, particularly younger people, spend more time in isolation within digital realms and experience fewer face-to-face interactions.

Physical health decline, with less movement leading to conditions like poor posture, eye strain... etc.

## Proposed Solution

Our project introduces a hybrid platform that blends physical movement and teamwork with immersive digital experiences. Unlike traditional VR, which detaches users from their environment, our app uses AR through phone cameras to create active, collaborative tasks grounded in the real world. It promotes physical activity and meaningful social interaction—both in-person and virtually—by gamifying movement and teamwork. The solution is designed to scale with emerging AR/VR hardware, offering even deeper immersion while keeping users engaged with the physical world around them. This approach helps bridge the gap between digital innovation and human well-being.

## Summary of Our Code

The project is a web-based AR application built with JavaScript, WebXR, Websocket, Three.js and Blender. It leverages the phone camera for real-time interaction, overlays game elements using WebAR, and includes multi-user capabilities through Websocket. The frontend handles camera feeds, while the backend syncs session data between users. The app logic encourages users to move around, collaborate, and defeat monsters in real time. The architecture is modular, allowing easy expansion into VR headsets or more complex game mechanics in the future.
